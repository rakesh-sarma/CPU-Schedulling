        Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is the preemptive version of Shortest
      Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the processor is allocated to the job
      closest to completion.n the SRTF scheduling algorithm, the execution of
      any process can be stopped after a certain amount of time. On arrival of
      every process, the short-term scheduler schedules those processes from the
      list of available processes & running processes that have the least
      remaining burst time.

        <h2>Advantages of SRTF</h2>
        <p>The main advantage of the SRTF algorithm is that it makes the
            processing of the jobs faster than the SJF algorithm, mentioned it's
            overhead charges are not counted.</p>

        <h2>Disadvantages of SRTF</h2>
        <p>In SRTF, the context switching is done a lot more times than in SJN
            due to more consumption of the CPU's valuable time for processing. The
            consumed time of CPU then adds up to its processing time and which
            then diminishes the advantage of fast processing of this algorithm.</p>
